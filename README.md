## Hi.

I’m Justin Castillo, a computer science student focused on data science and analytics. 

I love uncovering the stories hidden within massive amounts of information, and I feel that, as more and more data is collected and stored, this field will become increasingly vital. 

At this point in my journey, I’m seeking a Summer 2026 internship in Data Analysis or Data Science.

- I’m currently working on:
  - A time‑aware retail forecasting pipeline (Rossmann) with XGBoost and Optuna.
  - A credit‑risk scoring model (CatBoost + SHAP) with case‑level explanations.
  - An HR attrition project with a reproducible scikit‑learn pipeline and threshold tuning.
  - A DistilBERT sentiment service exposed via FastAPI and packaged with Docker.

- I’m currently learning:
  - PyTorch and modern NLP practices.
  - MLOps fundamentals: CI/CD on GitHub Actions, containerization, and basic cloud deployment.

- I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Open, real‑world analytics problems where a clear metric matters.
  - Turning exploratory notebooks into tested, reproducible pipelines.

- I’m looking for help with:
  - Standing up low‑cost deployments on AWS/GCP.
  - Best practices for monitoring model drift and calibration in production.

- Ask me about:
  - scikit‑learn pipelines, feature engineering, and evaluation.
  - XGBoost/CatBoost, Optuna, and SHAP‑based explainability.
  - SQL for analytics (CTEs, window functions) and experiment design.

- How to reach me:
  - Email: jcastillo.hotels@gmail.com
  - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-castillo-69351198

- Pronouns: He/Him

- Fun fact:
  - I have a Film degree, and CS will be my 2nd Bachelor's! CS is way more fun though.
